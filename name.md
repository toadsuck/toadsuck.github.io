# Why the funny name?

The name of this project is derived from "Toad Suck, Arkansas", which is a small community near my home in Conway with some interesting history.

> Long ago, steamboats traveled the Arkansas River when the water was at the right depth. When it wasn't,
> the captains and their crew tied up to wait where the Toad Suck Lock and Dam now spans the river.
> While they waited, they refreshed themselves at the local tavern there, to the dismay of the folks
> living nearby, who said: "They suck on the bottle 'til they swell up like toads." Hence, the name Toad Suck.
